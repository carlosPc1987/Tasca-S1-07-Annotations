## Overview
Project focused on the use of annotations in Java. Exercises span both built-in and custom annotations, showcasing how they enhance functionality, readability, and maintainability in object-oriented programming. This includes the use of `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and a user-defined annotation for object serialization.

## Technologies Used
- Java 21  
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git

## Structure Levels

| Level | Exercise | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1     | 1        | Class hierarchy: `Worker`, `OnlineWorker`, and `OnsiteWorker`. Use of `@Override` in child classes. |
|       |          | `OnsiteWorker` calculates salary using a static `fuelCost` value. |
|       |          | `OnlineWorker` uses a constant `internetFlatRate` added to the calculated salary. |
| 1     | 2        | Deprecated methods added to child classes with `@Deprecated`. External class calls deprecated methods using `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`. |
| 2     | 1        | Creation of a custom annotation for serializing objects to JSON. Annotation accepts output directory as a parameter. |

## Project Execution
- Clone the repository  
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA  
- Ensure Java SDK 21 is properly configured  
- Run the `Main` class or corresponding test  
- View the output in the console  

## Key Learnings
- Use of `@Override` and inheritance-based polymorphism  
- Annotation-driven code enhancement  
- Deprecated method management  
- Creation and application of custom annotations  
- JSON serialization through reflection  
- Code organization and best practices for GitHub repos
