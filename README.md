## Overview  
Project focused on the use of annotations in Java. Exercises span both built-in and custom annotations, showcasing how they enhance functionality, readability, and maintainability in object-oriented programming. This includes the use of `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and a user-defined annotation for object serialization.

## Technologies Used  
- Java 21  
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git

## Structure Levels  

| Level | Exercise | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1     | 1        | Class hierarchy: `Worker`, `OnlineWorker`, and `OnsiteWorker`. Child classes override `calculateSalary()` using `@Override`. `OnsiteWorker` adds `fuelCost`; `OnlineWorker` adds `internetFlatRate`. |
| 1     | 2        | Add deprecated methods using `@Deprecated`. Call them from an external class and suppress warnings with `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`. |
| 2     | 1        | Create a custom annotation to serialize objects to JSON. Accepts output directory as a parameter. |

## Project Execution  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA  
3. Ensure Java SDK 21 is properly configured  
4. Run the `Main` class or corresponding test  
5. View the output in the console

## Key Learnings  
- Use of `@Override` and inheritance-based polymorphism  
- Annotation-driven code enhancement  
- Deprecated method management  
- Creation and application of custom annotations  
- JSON serialization through reflection  
- Code organization and best practices for GitHub repos
